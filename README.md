## Customer Satisfaction Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer satisfaction ratings using customer support ticket data. The model identifies key factors affecting customer experience, such as response time, resolution time, ticket priority, and support channel.

# Objective
-	Predict customer satisfaction (1–5 scale)
-	Analyze customer support performance
-	Identify drivers of customer satisfaction
________________________________________

# Dataset
Customer support ticket dataset with 8,400+ records including:
-	Customer demographics
-	Ticket type, priority, and channel
-	Response and resolution time
-	Satisfaction rating (target)
________________________________________

# Tech Stack
-	Python
-	Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-	Scikit-learn
-	Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
________________________________________

# Model
-	Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
-	Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
________________________________________

# Key Insights
-	Response time and resolution time strongly impact satisfaction
-	High-priority tickets often correlate with lower satisfaction
-	Most prediction errors occur between adjacent rating levels
________________________________________

# Future Work
-	Apply NLP on ticket descriptions
-	Try advanced models (XGBoost, CatBoost)
-	Deploy using Flask or FastAPI
